### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mathematics and I've been teaching classes for about 5 years. To improve remote classes, I started taking an HTML course, and then I fell in love with other languages. I started taking small courses in the area and to close it with a flourish I passed the entrance exam at USJ.

I study Italian and I will start English.

I believe it's never too late to discover new dreams and do everything possible to achieve them.
